What is MazaCoin?
----------------

MazaCoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. MazaCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. MazaCoin is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the MazaCoin client sofware, see www.MazaCoin.org

Note
-------

This is a fork of ZetaCoin that works on OSX Mavericks with brew. Use at your own risk.
